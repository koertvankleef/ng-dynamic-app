We can embed a form in an arbitrary position on the page.

<hero-form></hero-form>

Notice the <i>required</i> field validations.

Imagine the data access and business logic that could lie behind this form component.

With a bit more work, we could create a form design experience in which the user dragged a form glyph from a "toolbox" onto a "dashboard canvas" and the app generated
the metadata to drive an experience like this.
