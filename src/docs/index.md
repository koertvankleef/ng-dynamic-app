# DocViewer Home

This project's <i>DocViewer</i> presents several free-form HTML pages with
Angular components <i>embedded</i> arbitrarily within those pages.


Each page, located in the <code>/docs</code> folder and linked to on the left,
illustrates a particular solution to a particular component presentation problem.

The pages are (mostly) ordered from simple to complex.

  The [long story](long-story "The long story about Angular Dynamic Content") attempts to explain the Angular Dynamic Content project
  in detail.

The <i>embedded component</i> demonstration begins right here, on this page,
with the <code>FortuneCookieComponent</code>.

  I opened your fortune cookie and it said, "<i><fortune></fortune></i>"
